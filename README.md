WHEN I view the source code
I could see that basic was done but the code was so poor of resources, that exist in HTML and CSS.
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.
There were missing a few elements as the main, nav, section with that the meaning of was not clearly described.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
The basic structure was done correctly on my view, <HTML>, <head>, <title> and <body>.
WHEN I view the image elements
I saw three classes float-right and float-left(2x), I let them as I found, because it was not duplicated in the HTML or CSS, for my view they were ok.
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
There were no alt attributes, I had to create three for each image.
WHEN I view the heading attributes
In my point of view, the heading attributes were set correctly, for each heading h1, h2 h3. I didn't feel the necessity to refactor those.
THEN they fall in sequential order
As section tags were created inside of each section they fall in sequential order.
WHEN I view the title element
The title didn't have a significant meaning and it was impossible for a significant search to understand what the site was about.
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
The title has been replaced by Search Engine Optimization.

















on the Section class benefits I replaced the following classes, benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost with the class benefit-item and shrinking the CSS file as well.
