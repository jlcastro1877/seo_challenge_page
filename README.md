In this project called starter code, I could refactor the code where I could add navigation tags, main tags, and section tags.
Where the code was repeated I could create just one class sharing a variety of elements and call the CSS code just once, simplifying the code and making it clear and easy to read.
The idea was to improve the code while maintaining the main idea, improving it without changing the UI.

The first class after the body tag was a header class and that was replaced by the main-header class.
On the nav class main-nav, it was created because a nav tag was missing on the code, there are buttons to link to the main text.

I've created the main-content class to replace the class content, given a better understanding of reading and to be located on the code.

Inside to main-content class I refactored the IDs to work properly with each link associated with it.
Inside to main-content class I replaced the repeated classes with just one class called content-item and with it I could shrink the CSS file as well.
Inside to main-content class I created sections that were missing in this part of the code.

Section class benefits replaced div class benefits
on the Section class benefits I replaced the following classes, benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost with the class benefit-item and shrinking the CSS file as well.
