In this project called starter code, I could refactor the code where I could add navigation tags, main tags, and section tags.
Where the code was repeated I could create just one class sharing a variety of elements and call the CSS code just once, simplifying the code and making it clear and easy to read.
The idea was to improve the code while maintaining the main idea, improving it without changing the UI.
